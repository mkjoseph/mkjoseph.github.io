  <p>Hi. My name is Max Levchin. <a href="http://twitter.com/mlevchin">@mlevchin.</a></p>
  <p><br></p>
  <p><i>Present:</i></p>
  <p>I co-founded and am the CEO of <a href="http://affirm.com/">Affirm</a>. We are going to remake consumer finance from the ground up.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>My other main project is <a href="http://glowing.com/">Glow</a>, where I am Chairman. </p>

  <p>Both Affirm and Glow came out of my data-as-commodity project <a href="http://hvflabs.com/">HVF</a>, which is working on new products.</p>
  <p><br></p>
  
  <p><i>Past:</i></p>

  <p>Was Chairman of <a href="http://www.yelp.com/">Yelp</a> for 11 years -- from its founding until July 2015.</p>

  <p>Founded and was CEO of Slide, which Google acquired, and subsequently shut down.</p>

  <p>Sat on the Board of Directors of <a href="http://yahoo.com/">Yahoo!</a> until December 2015. </p>

  <p>Before all that, I co-founded and was CTO of <a href="http://www.paypal.com/">PayPal</a>. You can take a look at some early <a href="http://www.levchin.com/paypal-slideshow">PayPal photos</a> here.  
  </p>
  <p><br></p>

  <p><i>Contact:</i></p>
  <p>You are welcome to contact me via whatever channel you like, but please do not be offended if I never respond, as I tend to be very busy.</p>
  <p>Sometimes I invest in small companies. If you want to send me your "pitch", please consider recording a pitch video, posting it on YouTube, and sending me the link. I found this approach to be very time-efficient.</p>
